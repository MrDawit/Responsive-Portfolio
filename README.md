## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (css framework)

## Included Files
* index.html
* portfolio.html

## Notes
* future aspects that need could be improved:
* blended borders,
* metalic and sharp edges for design (more professional and business minded),  
* (maybe) change portfolio images' css to css sprites, 
* change "align" attribute to something more html5
