 Project 2: Bootstrap Responsive Portfolio application

included html files:
index.html, portfolio.html, contact.html

included css files:
style.css

*images subfolder also included


-Tried to make a portfolio website that was specific to the task but encorporated elements that I wanted to try out and appreciated the look of.

future aspects that need could be improved:
blended borders,
metalic and sharp edges for design(maybe more professional or business minded), 
fix background issues, 
change portfolio images' css to css sprites, 
change "align" attribute to something more html5
